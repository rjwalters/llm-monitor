# LLM Monitor

Monitor your LLM subscription usage (**Claude**, **OpenAI Codex**, and **z.ai
GLM Coding Plan** accounts, one or many) from a macOS menu-bar widget, or
headless on Linux. It surfaces quota, reset times, and usage trends without
leaving your menu bar. Formerly **Claude Monitor**; see
[Upgrading to 2.0](#upgrading-to-20-claude-monitor--llm-monitor).

![Per-account usage history chart](docs/plot_window.png)

## Why?

Anthropic doesn't expose a documented public API for checking consumer
subscription usage (Pro/Max). The web dashboard at
https://claude.ai/settings/usage shows your limits but has no programmatic
equivalent.

LLM Monitor calls the same internal endpoints that Claude Code uses, using
OAuth tokens you provide, and renders the data locally on your Mac.

## Features

- **Live usage % in the menu bar** (Stats-app style), color-coded — orange at
  90%, red above 95%.
- **Summary table popover.** All accounts at a glance: session %, weekly %,
  reset times, data freshness, token health, and a one-click chart launcher
  per row.
- **Headroom score** (0–100). A single number — `100 − max(session %,
  weekly %)` — answering "which account should I be using". Default sort.
- **Click any column header to sort.** Account, Headroom, percents, reset
  times, freshness, token status. Chevron marks the active column; click
  again to flip direction. Rows without data sort to the bottom.
- **Pin which account drives the menu bar.** Radio button on each row. Click
  to pin; click again to revert to auto-pick (most-available). Pinning
  survives restarts.
- **Per-row history charts.** Click the chart icon to open a usage-history
  window for that account; the popover stays open so you can open several
  side-by-side and compare.
- **Multi-account.** Add accounts one at a time from **Add Account**, which has
  a Claude / z.ai / Codex picker, or bulk-import a `.env` file of
  `ACCOUNT_EMAIL_N` / `ACCOUNT_KEY_N` pairs. Many accounts need no adding at all:
  tokens in `~/.claude-oauth` or the Loom pool, keys in `~/.zai`, and Loom Codex
  profiles are picked up automatically.
- **Multi-provider.** Anthropic and OpenAI/ChatGPT (Codex) accounts sit side by
  side in the same table, each row tagged with a pixel-art provider badge. See
  [Adding an OpenAI (Codex) Account](#adding-an-openai-codex-account).
  A provider that reports no session window (ChatGPT often reports only a
  weekly one) shows "—" rather than a fabricated 0%.
- **Per-model sub-limits.** OpenAI accounts report per-model limits alongside
  the account-level window; these are stored and overlaid on the per-account
  history chart. The overlay is hidden for accounts that have none.
- **Roll Token wizard.** Guided revoke-all + re-mint for an account's
  long-lived token (right-click its row → "Roll Token…"). A temporary stopgap
  until Anthropic ships a token-management API — see
  [Rolling a Token](#rolling-a-token-revoke--re-mint).
- **Transcript token ingest.** Claude Code's own session transcripts are read
  on a slow cadence for their per-message token counters, giving an actual
  token-spend history alongside the percentage readings — see
  [Transcript Token Ingest](#transcript-token-ingest-tokens-sync). Counters
  only; message content is never read into the database or the log.
- **Quota calibration.** A rolling daily series of what one weekly rate-limit
  point actually costs — in tokens, cost-equivalent tokens, and dollars —
  exportable as JSON or CSV for an external consumer to watch for step changes,
  plotted as its own chart mode on the per-account history window, and backed
  by a built-in step-change alert (pool-wide tokens/point) that shows a small
  badge on the menu-bar icon and is logged in headless mode. See
  [Quota Calibration](#quota-calibration-calibrate).
- **All data stored locally** in SQLite at `~/.llm-monitor/usage.db`.

## Quick Install

### 1. Prerequisites

- macOS 14+ (Sonoma or later)
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed (you
  use it to generate the OAuth tokens via `claude setup-token`)

### 2. Download

Grab `LLMMonitor.zip` from
[Releases](https://github.com/rjwalters/llm-monitor/releases), unzip, and
move `LLMMonitor.app` to `/Applications`.

**First run:** right-click → **Open** (required for unsigned apps).

### 3. Get a Long-Lived OAuth Token

Run this in a terminal:

```bash
claude setup-token
```

It opens a browser, asks you to authorize, and prints a token like
`sk-ant-oat01-…`. These tokens are **long-lived (~1 year)** so a single
authorization powers the menu bar for the entire lifetime — no refresh dance
needed. If you ever need to revoke and replace one (e.g., after a leak), see
[Rolling a Token](#rolling-a-token-revoke--re-mint).

### 4. Add the Account

1. Click the menu-bar widget.
2. Click **+ Add Account** in the footer and pick the provider:
   - **Claude:** paste the `claude setup-token` token.
   - **z.ai:** enter a label (and optionally an email) and paste the GLM Coding Plan
     key.
   - **Codex:** nothing to paste. Loom profiles appear automatically; otherwise
     register a logged-in `CODEX_HOME`.
3. Click **Add Account** (or **Register CODEX_HOME**).

Your usage data shows up in the menu bar immediately.

### Multiple Accounts

If you maintain tokens for several accounts (e.g., in a `.env` for an agent
pool), use the **Bulk Import** field in the Add Account dialog
(`.env.example` in the repo is a starter template):

```env
ACCOUNT_EMAIL_1=you@example.com
ACCOUNT_KEY_1=sk-ant-oat01-...
ACCOUNT_EMAIL_2=agent@example.com
ACCOUNT_KEY_2=sk-ant-oat01-...
```

Point the importer at the file path; each pair is validated via a ping and
added on success. Pinning, sorting, and per-account charts work the same way
regardless of how the accounts were added.

#### Master account list (auto-loaded at launch)

Instead of importing by hand, keep a master list that the app loads every time
it starts:

- `~/.llm-monitor/accounts.env` — the master list (shared source of truth)
- `~/.llm-monitor/accounts.local.env` — local overrides and additions (keep
  this machine-specific; don't share it)

Both use the same `ACCOUNT_EMAIL_N` / `ACCOUNT_KEY_N` format. At launch the app
merges them (the local file **overrides** the master token for a matching email
and **appends** any new emails), then imports the result. Loading is
**additive**: accounts in the lists are added or have their token refreshed, but
accounts already in the app that aren't listed are left untouched — nothing is
removed. Store these files with `chmod 600`; they contain live tokens.

**Tokens** in these lists are Anthropic-only. They may *also* carry keyless
Codex **identity** entries — the intended-set declaration described in
[Declaring which identities a host should have](#declaring-which-identities-a-host-should-have)
— which is how you declare an intended set on a headless host with no popover
to paste into:

```env
ACCOUNT_EMAIL_3=agent3@example.com
ACCOUNT_PROVIDER_3=openai
ACCOUNT_HOME_LABEL_3=agent3
```

No `ACCOUNT_KEY_3` — there is no credential to carry. On every launch this
creates the placeholder if it isn't there and does nothing at all if it is
(including after the identity has actually been provisioned), so it is safe to
keep in a shared master list across the whole fleet.

### Loom Codex Profiles (read-only)

If this host runs Loom, every profile in `~/.loom/codex-profiles/<name>`
(or `$LOOM_CODEX_PROFILE_ROOT`) appears automatically as an OpenAI account.
There is nothing to register.

These homes belong to Loom's session containers, which serialize OpenAI's
rotating refresh token. So llm-monitor **never runs `codex` against them and
never reads their credentials**. It reads only the rate-limit snapshot Codex
records in each profile's `sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl` during normal use.

Snapshots have trade-offs:

- **A reading is only as fresh as the account's last Codex turn.** It is
  stamped with when Codex recorded it, so an idle profile shows as stale
  rather than current.
- **Expired windows are dropped.** Once a window's reset time has passed, the
  reading shows as unknown rather than as its old percentage.
- **Registration is refused.** `codex add --home` rejects a profile path; a
  profile needs no registration.

`llm-monitor codex list` shows each profile's latest snapshot and its age.

### Adding an OpenAI (Codex) Account

ChatGPT subscription accounts (Plus/Pro, the ones Codex CLI uses) are polled
too, and no inference request is burned to read their usage.

**How the reading is taken.** There are two ways to ask, and the poller tries
them in order, preferring whichever touches the fewest credentials. This app
stores no OpenAI credential of its own (#104) — both tiers read through
whatever the Codex CLI already owns:

1. **`codex app-server`** (preferred). The app runs
   `codex -s read-only -a never app-server`, speaks JSON-RPC over its stdio,
   and reads `account/rateLimits/read`. **Codex owns the credential end to end
   — this app never reads, stores, or refreshes an OpenAI token on this path.**
   Requires `codex` **0.147.0 or newer**: the method does not exist in 0.46.0
   (the version Homebrew's formula lags at), which answers `-32600` instead.
   Install the current CLI with `npm i -g @openai/codex`; it ships
   `linux-x64` / `linux-arm64` binaries, so this works on headless Linux hosts
   too.

   Homebrew ships **two** `codex` packages, and it's easy to end up on the
   wrong one: `brew install codex` installs the **formula**, which is the
   stale 0.46.0 build above. The current 0.147.0+ CLI is the **cask**. If
   you're already on the formula, switch with:

   ```bash
   brew uninstall --formula codex && brew install --cask codex
   ```

   `brew uninstall --formula` may autoremove now-unused dependencies pulled in
   only for the formula (observed: it took `ripgrep` with it on one host) —
   reinstall anything you still want separately. The cask also does **not**
   self-update in the background (`auto_updates` is `null` in its cask
   definition, unlike a cask that manages its own updater) — `brew update`
   alone won't pull in a new `codex` release, so re-running
   `brew upgrade --cask codex` periodically is on you.
2. **`auth.json` at request time.** `GET https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage`
   — the same endpoint Codex CLI's own `/usage` command calls — with the bearer
   read fresh out of that account's own Codex home's `auth.json` (its registered
   `codex_home`, or `$CODEX_HOME`/`~/.codex` for the ambient account) for that one
   request. Never written back, never refreshed.

A tier that is merely *unavailable* — no `codex` on the host, a `codex` too old,
no readable `auth.json` — falls through silently to the next one. Only a genuine
failure of the last tier marks the account unhealthy: there is no
stored-credential fallback below it any more, so a home that isn't logged in
(or a host with no `codex` binary and no readable `auth.json`) shows up as a
red Token dot rather than quietly polling a stale copy of the credential.

`codex` is located by absolute path, first hit wins: `$LLM_MONITOR_CODEX_BIN`,
then each `PATH` entry, then `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`,
`~/.local/bin`, `~/.npm-global/bin`, `~/.nvm/versions/node/current/bin`. (A macOS app launched from Finder inherits
launchd's minimal `PATH`, which contains neither Homebrew's nor npm's bin
directory — hence the explicit list.) Set `LLM_MONITOR_CODEX_BIN` to point at
a specific install.

**Registering an account: one `CODEX_HOME` per account.** `codex login` writes a
single `auth.json` per home directory, so **each login overwrites the previous
account's credential** — which is why monitoring more than one Codex account
never worked before. Give each account its own home and register it by that
path. The one-command way:

```bash
llm-monitor codex provision work
```

`provision <label>` collapses "pick a home, log in, register it" into one
step: it creates (or reuses, if already present) `~/.codex-<label>` as that
identity's `CODEX_HOME`, drives `codex login --device-auth` against it
interactively, and on success registers it exactly as `codex add --home`
does — reusing the same registration code, not a parallel implementation.
Re-running it for a label that's already logged in skips the login step and
just re-registers (idempotent — it will not create a second account row), and
it fails clearly, before touching anything, if `<label>` is missing or
`codex` itself can't be found. If the home is already registered to one
account but is now logged in as a *different* one, it fails rather than
silently repointing the registration — log out and back in with the intended
identity, or provision a different `<label>`.

That one command is equivalent to the three manual steps it replaces:

```bash
CODEX_HOME=~/.codex-work codex login --device-auth
llm-monitor codex add --home ~/.codex-work
```

Reach for the manual form when you want the steps decoupled — e.g. running
`codex login --device-auth` on one machine and `codex add --home` on another
that shares the same `CODEX_HOME` over a network filesystem. Either way,
`--device-auth` prints a code you paste into a browser on any machine, so this
works on a **headless Linux host** with no browser at all. Repeat for as many
accounts as you have; each poll then spawns `codex` with that account's own
`CODEX_HOME`, so one account's numbers can never land on another's row.

`codex add` **reads, copies, and stores no token.** It reads exactly one field
out of `<home>/auth.json` — the opaque `account_id` that keys the account row —
and asks `codex` itself for the identity and usage. The credential stays where
Codex CLI put it.

```bash
llm-monitor codex list
# ACCOUNT   PLAN        AUTH               CODEX_HOME
# user-3f2… pro         logged in          /Users/you/.codex-work
# user-91a… plus        needs login        /Users/you/.codex-personal
# user-77c… pro         drift → user-0d4…  /Users/you/.codex-spare
# openai-b… —           absent             (not provisioned on this host)
#   → llm-monitor codex provision agent3
# user-5e1… pro         stranded           (none registered — nothing left to poll with)
#   → llm-monitor codex add --home <path>
```

`list` reports each home's live state: **logged in**, **needs login** (the home
exists but `codex login` hasn't been run in it), **home missing** (the directory
is gone — re-register), **drift** (see below), **absent** (see
[Declaring which identities a host should have](#declaring-which-identities-a-host-should-have)),
**stranded** (see below), or **unknown** when `codex` itself is absent or too
old. Both commands take `--db <path>` to work against a throwaway store.

**stranded** means this host has polled the account before but now has nothing
left to poll it with: no stored token (this app keeps no OpenAI credential —
they are cleared on every launch, see `codex import` below) and no `CODEX_HOME`
of its own. It is the state an account added by *token import* ends up in once
it is no longer the host's only OpenAI account, and it is permanent until a home
is registered — the row simply stops updating. Neither a stranded nor an absent
row is ever probed against the ambient `~/.codex`: that home belongs to at most
one account, so asking it would report a stranger's login state as this row's.
Fix it with `codex add --home <path>` (or `codex provision <label>` to create
the home and log in). The popover names the same condition in the hover text on
the affected row's status dot.

**drift** means that home is now logged in as a *different* account than the row
it was registered against — someone ran `codex login` in it again with another
identity. The poller has always refused to attribute such a reading to the wrong
account; `list` names it here, and names the account id the home currently holds
(or prints a bare `drift` when the home's `auth.json` carries no account id and
only the email disagrees — an email is never printed). The popover names the
same condition on the affected row: an orange dot instead of the usual
green/red/gray, with the identity and remediation in the hover text, and the
row's percentages stop updating rather than presenting stale numbers as current.
Fix it by logging the home back in as the original account, or by re-running
`codex add --home <home>` to register it as its own account — either way, the
row clears back to normal on the next poll with no restart needed.

An account with **no** registered home reads the ambient `$CODEX_HOME` (else
`~/.codex`), exactly as before — which is correct as long as it is the only
OpenAI account on the host. Add a second OpenAI account and any account still
lacking its own home stops using the ambient one (it can speak for only one of
them, and nothing says which); register its home to bring it back. (A merely
*declared* identity — see immediately below — is not a second account for this
purpose: it has no login here, so it never triggers that ambiguity.)

#### Declaring which identities a host should have

**Homes are host-local and are never synced.** `codex login` writes a
credential into one `CODEX_HOME` on one machine; copying it elsewhere is
explicitly a non-goal (see [Multi-Host Sync](#multi-host-sync) — OpenAI
supports one `auth.json` per machine and rotates the refresh token on every
use, so two hosts sharing a copy just invalidate each other). Every host must
run `codex provision <label>` for itself, once per identity.

That leaves a gap worth naming: with three Codex identities across a fleet,
a host that was only ever provisioned with two looks *exactly* like a host
that was supposed to have two. There is no missing row to notice — the
identity simply isn't there.

So the set of identities a host is *expected* to have travels on the account
copy/paste you already use. **There is no config file and no new command.**

1. On a host that has the identities, click **Copy** in the popover (or run
   the equivalent export). Anthropic accounts travel with their token as
   always; each Codex account travels as an **identity only** — its email, its
   provider, and its home *label* (the `<label>` half of `~/.codex-<label>`),
   with **no key**.
2. On the host that should have them, click **Paste**. Each identity that
   isn't already present becomes a placeholder: an account row with no
   credential and no home. (On a headless host with no popover, put the same
   keyless entries in `~/.llm-monitor/accounts.env` — see
   [Master account list](#master-account-list-auto-loaded-at-launch).)

**No credential of any kind crosses in either direction, and neither does a
home path** (a path names a user; only the label you chose travels). This is
purely a naming layer over data the app already had.

A declared-but-unprovisioned identity is then visible everywhere, without you
having to go looking:

- **In the popover** — greyed, with an `absent` badge, and every percentage
  blank. It is never auto-selected for the menu bar and never ranks as
  "most available" on its empty reading.
- **In `codex list`** — status `absent`, with the exact remediation beside it:
  `→ llm-monitor codex provision agent3`.
- **In `ranking.json`** — `"absent": true` alongside `"status": "blocked"`, so
  an external load balancer excludes it whether or not it understands the new
  key (see [Ranking Export](#ranking-export-rankingjson)).

Run the printed `codex provision <label>` on that host and the placeholder
**converts in place** into a real, polling account — same row, no duplicate,
no cleanup step. Nothing else has to be told.

Two things this deliberately does *not* do:

- **Pasting never deletes a Codex account.** An identity-only entry says "this
  host should have this identity"; it is not a claim that any identity missing
  from the payload is unwanted. A host with an *extra* provisioned identity
  keeps it, untouched and unflagged. (Anthropic entries keep their existing
  replace semantics, since they carry a full credential.)
- **Declaring an identity you already have changes nothing.** The paste
  resolves onto the existing row and leaves its home and credential alone, so
  pasting the same payload twice — or pasting it back onto the host it came
  from — is a no-op.

<details>
<summary><b>Importing a credential instead (<code>codex import</code>)</b></summary>

The original path still works, for hosts without a usable `codex` binary:

```bash
codex login
llm-monitor codex import
```

The importer reads `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json` when `CODEX_HOME` is set, otherwise
`~/.codex/auth.json`. Pass `--auth <path>` to read a different file. The
credential is validated against the live usage endpoint before it's stored, and
the account's email, plan, and OpenAI account id all come back in that same
response — there's no separate profile call.

Prefer `codex add`: it stores no token at all. `codex import` still stores one
transiently to validate the credential and identify the account, but a
healing migration nulls it out again on the app's very next launch (#104) —
ongoing polling reads through the tiers above, not the stored copy.

**That only holds while some home can speak for the account.** Once this host
has a second OpenAI account, the ambient `~/.codex` belongs to at most one of
them and may speak for neither, so an imported account with no `CODEX_HOME` of
its own has no tier left and stops updating for good — the **stranded** state
above. `codex import` warns when it detects this at import time; either way the
fix is to give the account a home of its own with `codex add --home` or
`codex provision`.

</details>

What differs from an Anthropic row once it's added:

- **Session % may be blank.** OpenAI reports its windows as
  `primary_window` / `secondary_window`, each carrying its own length, and a
  ChatGPT Pro account can legitimately report only a **weekly** window. When
  there's no session window, the Session cells show `—`. That is a real
  "unknown", not 0% — the headroom score and sorting use whichever windows
  actually exist.
- **Premium % / Extra are always `—`.** Those columns track Anthropic
  premium tiers; the Fable probe is skipped for OpenAI accounts entirely. The
  premium column is titled "Fable %" only when every account in the table is
  Anthropic, and "Premium %" in a mixed table. With **no** Anthropic account in
  the table, both columns are hidden and the popover narrows to fit.
- **This app stores no OpenAI credential, and renews nothing.** Usage is read
  via `codex app-server` (tier 1) or a one-time `auth.json` bearer read (tier
  2); either way the Codex CLI owns the credential and its own renewal
  entirely, and this app touches neither. The Auth dot reports the outcome:
  green (a tier read succeeded), **red** (every tier failed — most often the
  home isn't logged in; hover for the reason, then run `codex login` or
  register the right home with `llm-monitor codex add --home <path>`). A
  stale OpenAI account never fails silently.

### Adding a z.ai (GLM Coding Plan) Account

z.ai Coding Plan keys are static API keys, so they work like Claude tokens:
the key is stored and polled directly. Usage comes from
`GET https://api.z.ai/api/monitor/usage/quota/limit`, which is read-only and
spends no quota. It reports a **5-hour** window and a **weekly** window, shown
in the same columns as Claude's.

Keys are read from `~/.zai/coding-plan-<label>.env` (chezmoi-managed on
operator Macs; override the directory with `$LLM_MONITOR_ZAI_DIR`). Each
file holds one `ZAI_API_KEY=…` line, and an `(account: <email>)` header comment
names the account:

```bash
llm-monitor zai import     # register every coding-plan-<label>.env
llm-monitor zai list       # last stored 5h / weekly usage per account
# one key from a file or stdin (never argv):
llm-monitor zai add agent3 --key-file ~/.zai/coding-plan-agent3.env
```

The app also scans that directory **at every launch**, so a rotated key is
picked up without a re-import. An unchanged key is skipped without a network
call, and a deleted file never removes its account. `coding-plan.env`
(opencode's `ZHIPU_API_KEY` copy) is ignored, so it does not register a
duplicate. Accounts are keyed `zai:<email>` (else `zai:<label>`), so a
rotation rolls the credential in place. In `ranking.json` they appear with
`"provider": "zai"`, and a spent window reports `exhausted`/`rate_limited`.

### Rolling a Token (revoke + re-mint)

> **Temporary workaround.** Anthropic exposes no supported API to list, revoke,
> or programmatically mint long-lived `sk-ant-oat01` tokens, so this workflow
> leans on undocumented claude.ai internals plus manual browser steps. It
> should be revisited (and ideally replaced) once Anthropic ships a real
> token-management API — see
> [anthropics/claude-code#43801](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/43801)
> (revocation doesn't reliably invalidate tokens),
> [#22995](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/22995)
> (token/session management dashboard request),
> [#48373](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/48373)
> (`claude setup-token --list` / `--revoke` request), and
> [#59378](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/59378)
> (per-session token minting).

If a token leaks — or you just want to rotate one — right-click the account's
row in the popover and choose **"Roll Token…"**. A per-account wizard window
opens (its header shows a "Last rolled …" timestamp) and walks you through
four steps:

1. **Log in as this account.** A button opens
   `https://claude.ai/settings/claude-code` in your browser; make sure the
   browser is signed in as the account being rolled.
2. **Revoke the old tokens.** A button copies a browser-console script with
   the account's org id baked in. Paste it into the browser console (⌥⌘J) on
   the logged-in claude.ai page and press Return. It revokes **every**
   authorization token on the account — this signs out all devices using it.
3. **Mint a new token.** Run `claude setup-token` in a terminal (copy button
   provided), complete the browser login, and paste the printed
   `sk-ant-oat01-…` back into the wizard. The wizard verifies the token and
   **rejects it if its org id doesn't match the account being rolled** — a
   guard against accidentally pasting a different account's token into the
   wrong roll.
4. **Verify the old token is revoked.** After a successful import, the wizard
   pings the token this account had *before* the roll. If the API rejects it
   with 401 you get "Revoked ✓"; if it still answers (200 or 429 — both mean
   the token still authenticates) you get "Still valid!"; a network or server
   error shows "Couldn't check".

#### Why it works this way (undocumented endpoints)

The console script hits internal claude.ai endpoints with no public,
documented equivalent:

- List tokens:
  `GET https://claude.ai/api/oauth/organizations/{org}/oauth_tokens`
- Revoke one:
  `POST https://claude.ai/api/oauth/organizations/{org}/oauth_tokens/{id}/revoke`

Both authenticate with the **claude.ai web session cookie**
(`credentials: 'include'`), not the Bearer token — the OAuth token itself gets
`account_session_invalid`. That's why revocation can only run pasted into a
browser console on a logged-in claude.ai page, never from the app itself.
Minting can't be automated either: `claude setup-token` requires interactive
browser OAuth.

The script is defensive about known flakiness: it re-lists live tokens between
revoke rounds and retries stragglers for up to 10 rounds, and a 403 on the
list call means the browser is logged into a different account (the script
aborts with a clear error).

Because these endpoints are undocumented, they may change without notice. If a
roll stops working, the script template in `TokenRoller.revokeAllScript`
(`menubar-app/LLMMonitor/Sources/TokenRoller.swift`) is the single place to
update.

Finally, server-side revocation is known to lag or silently fail (see
anthropics/claude-code#43801 above) — which is exactly why step 4 exists: the
app independently verifies the old token with its own ping rather than
trusting that the revoke succeeded.

## Direct API Access (no app needed)

The whole app is just a wrapper around a single, cheap API call. With a
`sk-ant-oat01-…` token from `claude setup-token` you can fetch the same usage
data the menu bar shows, using only `curl`. Both a 200 (Haiku reply) and a 429
(rate-limited) response carry the usage data in headers:

```bash
TOKEN='sk-ant-oat01-...'   # from `claude setup-token`

curl -sS -D - -o /dev/null https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20" \
  -H "User-Agent: claude-code/2.0.37" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001","max_tokens":1,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"x"}]}' \
  | grep -i '^anthropic-'
```

The interesting headers in the response:

| Header                                        | Meaning                              |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `anthropic-organization-id`                   | Which account this token belongs to  |
| `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-5h-utilization`  | Session quota used (0.0–1.0)         |
| `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-5h-reset`        | Session reset (epoch seconds)        |
| `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-7d-utilization`  | Weekly quota used (0.0–1.0)          |
| `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-7d-reset`        | Weekly reset (epoch seconds)         |
| `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-status`          | `allowed` / `allowed_warning` / etc. |

Each call costs ~1 Haiku output token (effectively free). The
`oauth-2025-04-20` beta flag is what lets the OAuth-issued token authenticate
against `/v1/messages`.

## Development

### Requirements

- macOS 14+ (Sonoma or later)
- Xcode 16+ (Swift 6.0+ toolchain — the package builds in Swift 6 language mode) with the Command Line Tools installed (`xcode-select --install`)
- Claude Code (to generate tokens)

### Build & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rjwalters/llm-monitor.git
cd llm-monitor/menubar-app/LLMMonitor
swift build
.build/debug/LLMMonitor &
```

CI (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) runs on pushes to `main` and on pull requests:
two jobs build the package — macOS and a `swift:6.1` Linux container — and each
runs `LLMMonitor selftest`, with the Linux job also smoke-running `--once`.

**Manually re-triggering CI.** The `push`/`pull_request` webhook deliveries
that normally queue a run can silently stop firing for a stretch of time —
with no change to the workflow file, Actions settings, or repo state (see
[#66](https://github.com/rjwalters/llm-monitor/issues/66)). Since the
workflow also carries a bare `workflow_dispatch:` trigger, you can queue a run
directly against any branch (including an open PR's head) without depending
on that webhook:

```bash
gh workflow run build.yml --ref <branch-name>
```

or use the Actions tab's "Run workflow" button. If checks are missing on an
open PR and re-running doesn't help, next check (needs repo-admin access):
Settings → Actions → General (Actions permissions toggle), Settings →
Webhooks → Recent Deliveries (look for failed/missing `pull_request`
deliveries), and https://www.githubstatus.com/history for an Actions/Webhooks
incident.

### Build for Distribution

```bash
./scripts/build-macos-app.sh
```

The script auto-detects the installed `claude-code` version (from
`claude --version`, falling back to the npm global listing) and patches
the User-Agent string in `AnthropicAPI.swift` before compiling. Output:
`build/LLMMonitor.app` and `build/LLMMonitor.zip`.

When replacing `/Applications/LLMMonitor.app`, you must `rm -rf` the old
bundle before copying — `cp -R` over a running app does not replace the
binary. See `CLAUDE.md` for the exact sequence.

## Headless Mode / Linux

The same package builds on Linux as a headless daemon — no UI, same poll loop
(account-file sync, 10-minute usage pings, 20-minute Fable probes) writing the
same `~/.llm-monitor/usage.db` and `ranking.json`. This is what Loom hosts
run.

### Quick install (recommended)

`scripts/install-linux.sh` automates the whole standing-up sequence — acquire
a binary, refuse one that's dynamically linked, install it, wire up the
systemd user unit, seed accounts — in one idempotent, re-runnable command:

```bash
# Fastest path: download the latest static-stdlib release asset, no Swift
# toolchain needed. Installs to ~/.local/bin (no sudo) and starts the unit.
./scripts/install-linux.sh --from-release

# No GitHub release available yet: build in the swift:6.1 container instead
# (requires docker, no local Swift toolchain).
./scripts/install-linux.sh --from-source

# Already have a binary (built by hand, copied from another host, ...):
./scripts/install-linux.sh --binary /path/to/LLMMonitor

# System-wide install instead of the per-user default (sudo used only here):
./scripts/install-linux.sh --from-release --prefix /usr/local

# Seed accounts.env at install time (see "Multiple Accounts" below):
./scripts/install-linux.sh --from-release --accounts-env /path/to/accounts.env
```

Re-running the script upgrades an already-installed daemon in place and
restarts the unit when a newer binary is available, and reports a no-op when
the version is unchanged. It refuses to install a dynamically-linked binary
(printing the `ldd` evidence) before touching the filesystem — the failure
mode that leaves a host with a unit that can't start. Run
`./scripts/install-linux.sh --help` for the full flag list.

The rest of this section explains what the script automates, for manual
installs, upgrades, or troubleshooting.

### Build (Linux)

The quickest path needs no Swift toolchain at all: every
[GitHub Release](https://github.com/rjwalters/llm-monitor/releases) carries
a statically-linked `llm-monitor-linux-x64` asset (no dynamic Swift/
Foundation dependency — verified in CI via `ldd`), so `curl`-ing it down and
`chmod +x` is enough to run it on a bare host. To build from source instead:

Requires a Swift toolchain ([swift.org](https://www.swift.org/install/) or the
`swift:6.1` Docker image) and the SQLite dev headers:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev   # (yum: sqlite-devel)
cd llm-monitor/menubar-app/LLMMonitor
swift build -c release --static-swift-stdlib
sudo cp .build/release/LLMMonitor /usr/local/bin/llm-monitor
```

**Use `--static-swift-stdlib` for any binary you intend to deploy.** A plain
`swift build` links against the Swift runtime in `/usr/lib/swift/linux`
(`libswiftCore`, `libFoundation*`, `libdispatch`, …), so the binary dies with
`libswiftSwiftOnoneSupport.so: cannot open shared object file` the moment it is
copied to a host without the toolchain — or the toolchain is removed from the
build host afterwards. Statically linking the stdlib makes the binary
self-contained apart from `libsqlite3-0` (see below).

#### No toolchain on the host? Build in a container

Build the deployable binary inside the `swift:6.1` image and copy the result
out — no Swift install on either the build host or the target (verified
2026-09-16, ~47 s):

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD/menubar-app/LLMMonitor:/src" -w /src swift:6.1 bash -c \
  'apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y -qq libsqlite3-dev && swift build -c release --static-swift-stdlib'
sudo cp menubar-app/LLMMonitor/.build/release/LLMMonitor /usr/local/bin/llm-monitor
```

Run it from the repository root (the bind mount is relative to `$PWD`).

#### Runtime requirement

A statically-linked build still needs **`libsqlite3-0`** at runtime — the
package uses the system SQLite, not a vendored copy. It is already present on
Ubuntu 24.04; on a minimal image install it with `apt-get install libsqlite3-0`.
Confirm the binary has no other unmet dependencies:

```bash
ldd /usr/local/bin/llm-monitor | grep 'not found'   # should print nothing
```

### Run

Put your accounts in `~/.llm-monitor/accounts.env`
(`ACCOUNT_EMAIL_N` / `ACCOUNT_KEY_N` pairs, same format as the app's bulk
import — see [Multiple Accounts](#multiple-accounts)), then:

```bash
llm-monitor                  # poll loop, logs to stdout + ~/.llm-monitor/debug.log
llm-monitor --once           # one poll cycle, write ranking.json, exit
llm-monitor --interval 300   # override per-account poll interval (seconds, min 60)
llm-monitor --version        # print the version and exit
llm-monitor calibrate        # daily tokens/cost per weekly point, JSON on stdout
llm-monitor selftest         # self-check (no network/credentials); non-zero exit on failure
```

`selftest` also takes `--db <path>` (migrate and verify a **copy** of a real
database — it writes, so never point it at the live `usage.db`) and
`--wire <path>` (decode a captured `/wham/usage` body offline to re-check the
OpenAI wire contract; prints only derived numbers, never identity fields).
`--codex` additionally runs one real `codex app-server` handshake against the
installed binary (opt-in: it needs a logged-in Codex home).
Run `llm-monitor selftest --help` for details.

A couple of checks spawn the CLI itself (the `accounts push` channel is tested
end to end against a stub `ssh`). Those are skipped unless the running
executable *is* the CLI — i.e. it was started as `llm-monitor selftest`. If you
host the suite from your own harness binary instead, point
`LLM_MONITOR_CLI=/path/to/llm-monitor` at the real CLI to run them; without it
they are reported as skipped rather than re-executing a binary that cannot
answer `accounts import`. `LLM_MONITOR_SELFTEST_DEPTH` is the matching
tripwire — it is set in the spawned child's environment, and `selftest` refuses
to start when it is already present, so the suite can never recursively invoke
itself.

Edits to `accounts.env` / `accounts.local.env` are picked up automatically
while the daemon runs. A sample systemd user unit is provided at
`scripts/llm-monitor.service`.

On macOS the same headless loop is available as `LLMMonitor --headless`
(the bare binary or the app bundle's `Contents/MacOS/LLMMonitor`).
`LLMMonitor --version` prints the version and exits on macOS with or
without `--headless` — it never launches the GUI. `--once` and `--interval`
are headless-loop flags: bare (without `--headless`) they print an error to
stderr and exit non-zero rather than launching a duplicate GUI instance, e.g.
`LLMMonitor --headless --once`.

## Multi-Host Sync

When multiple hosts each run their own `llm-monitor` (e.g. two Macs + a
fleet of headless Linux workers), account records and OAuth credentials added
on one host don't automatically appear on the others. `llm-monitor accounts
push` / `pull` converges them over ssh — no GUI required, works identically on
macOS and Linux:

```bash
# From the host that has the account: fan it out to the whole fleet.
llm-monitor accounts push robb-pro loom-worker-1 loom-worker-2

# Check reachability first, without sending anything:
llm-monitor accounts push robb-pro loom-worker-1 --dry-run

# On a Loom host, chain the step that always follows an import:
llm-monitor accounts push loom-worker-1 --then-loom

# Bootstrapping a fresh host instead? Pull from a peer that already has them.
llm-monitor accounts pull robb-studio
```

- **Nothing is written to disk on either side.** `push` serializes the bundle
  in memory and streams it into `accounts import -` on the destination over
  the ssh channel; `pull` is the same channel in reverse. There is no
  plaintext-token file to `scp`, to `chmod`, or to remember to delete — the
  failure mode that made the manual `export` → `scp` → `import` → `rm` dance
  worth replacing.
- **One unreachable host doesn't strand the fleet.** Every host is attempted;
  each reports its own `created / updated / skipped` exactly as `import` does,
  prefixed with the host name. The exit status is non-zero if **any** host
  failed, so a bootstrap script can gate on it.
- **`--dry-run` sends nothing.** It checks that each host is reachable and that
  `llm-monitor` resolves there (reporting its version) — the failure that
  actually bites a fan-out — without putting a credential on the wire for a
  preview.
- **`--then-loom`** runs `loom-daemon tokens import-from-monitor --shared` on
  whichever host received the bundle (the remote one for `push`, this one for
  `pull`), and only after a successful import — chained with `&&`, so a failed
  import never re-publishes the old tokens as if it had worked.
- **ssh specifics:** `HOST` is anything ssh accepts (`user@host`, an
  `~/.ssh/config` alias). ssh runs with `BatchMode=yes`, so key/agent auth is
  required and an unknown host key fails fast instead of hanging on a prompt
  nobody can answer — run `ssh HOST true` once first. Pass extra ssh arguments
  with a repeatable `--ssh-option` (e.g. `--ssh-option -p --ssh-option 2222`).
  On `exit 127` (command not found), reach for `--remote-bin <absolute path>`:
  a non-interactive `ssh HOST <command>` shell doesn't source the profile that
  puts `~/.local/bin` on `PATH`.
- **No time limit, by default.** A host is given as long as it needs: a
  fleet-sized bundle over a slow link is slow, and cutting one off mid-delivery
  would leave that host half-converged. Set
  `LLM_MONITOR_SUBPROCESS_TIMEOUT_SECS=<seconds>` to put a ceiling on each ssh
  child for an unattended run — a host still going at the deadline is killed
  (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL) and reported as a per-host timeout, and the remaining
  hosts are still attempted. A non-positive or unparseable value means no
  ceiling, so a mistyped backstop can never fail a push on its own.

`export` / `import` remain the building blocks `push`/`pull` are made of, and
are still the right tool when there is no ssh path between two hosts:

```bash
# On the source host: dump account records + credentials to a file (0600).
llm-monitor accounts export --output accounts.json

# Copy it to each destination host over a trusted channel (scp, etc.),
# then converge that host's own usage.db:
llm-monitor accounts import accounts.json
```

- **What's synced:** Anthropic account identity (id, name, email, plan) and
  OAuth credentials (access/refresh tokens, expiry, scopes, plan tier). Usage
  history, rankings, and poll status are **not** synced — those stay local to
  each host's own polling.
- **Codex/OpenAI accounts are host-local and excluded on purpose:** `export`
  never emits one, and `import` skips (rather than errors on) any it finds in
  a bundle from an older version. Codex usage is read via `codex app-server`
  against a per-account `CODEX_HOME`, and OpenAI supports exactly one
  `auth.json` per machine — shipping a copy of that credential to another host
  only guarantees the two hosts take turns invalidating each other's copy.
  Register a Codex account on each host instead: `llm-monitor codex
  provision <label>`. To carry across *which identities a host should have*
  (names only, still no credentials), use the popover's Copy/Paste — see
  [Declaring which identities a host should have](#declaring-which-identities-a-host-should-have).
- **Idempotent, upsert-by-email:** `import` matches accounts by email
  (falling back to id when email is absent), creates any account it doesn't
  find locally, and updates the rest — except it **never regresses a newer
  local record**: if the local `last_updated` is at least as recent as the
  imported one, that account is left untouched. Safe to re-run against the
  same file, and safe to import an older export after newer local polls.
  `--dry-run` previews the account count without writing anything, and `-` as
  the path reads the export from stdin.
- **A fresh host needs no prior store:** `import` creates
  `~/.llm-monitor/usage.db` (directory, file, and schema) when the
  destination has never launched the app or the daemon, so a new worker can be
  converged before it has polled once. `export` still refuses a host with no
  store — there is nothing there to export, and an empty bundle would look
  like a successful one.
- **Credentials are secrets:** the export is plaintext JSON containing live
  OAuth tokens. `--output <path>` (`-o`) writes it with `0600` permissions and the
  command prints a warning either way (`--compact` drops the pretty-printing); without `--output` (stdout, e.g. for
  `> accounts.json`) permissions aren't set for you — `chmod 600` the result,
  transfer it over a trusted channel, and delete it once every destination
  host has imported. Full at-rest/in-transit encryption (age, openssl) is a
  natural next step but out of scope for the first pass here.
- **No `--headless` flag needed** — `accounts export`/`import` are one-shot
  operations, reachable directly on both platforms even from the macOS GUI
  build: `LLMMonitor accounts export ...`.

Run `llm-monitor accounts --help` for the full flag list.

## Ranking Export (`ranking.json`)

After every poll cycle the app writes a small, **non-secret**, email-keyed
snapshot to `~/.llm-monitor/ranking.json` for external multi-account load
balancers (notably `loom-daemon`, which uses it to pick a token). It's written
atomically, so a reader never sees a partial document.

```jsonc
{
  "schema": 1,
  "generated_at": "2026-07-30T18:00:00Z",
  "accounts": [
    {
      "email":       "you@example.com",   // the join key
      "provider":    "anthropic",         // "anthropic" | "openai"
      "plan":        "max_20x",
      "status":      "available",         // available | rate_limited | exhausted | blocked
      "utilization": { "5h": 0.12, "7d": 0.44 },   // 0.0–1.0
      "resets":      { "5h": "…Z", "7d": "…Z" },
      "models":      { "fable": { "utilization": 0.30 } },   // optional
      "updated_at":  "2026-07-30T17:58:00Z"
    },
    {
      "email":       "you@example.com",
      "provider":    "openai",
      "plan":        "pro",
      "status":      "available",
      "utilization": { "7d": 0.14 },      // note: no "5h" key — see below
      "resets":      { "7d": "…Z" },
      "updated_at":  "2026-07-30T17:58:00Z"
    },
    {
      "email":       "agent3@example.com",
      "provider":    "openai",
      "status":      "blocked",           // never routable
      "absent":      true                 // …because it isn't set up on this host
      // no utilization / resets / updated_at: nothing has ever been read here
    }
  ]
}
```

**Schema change for consumers (added with OpenAI support):**

- **`provider` is new and additive.** It is emitted for *every* account and is
  `"anthropic"` or `"openai"`; accounts that predate multi-provider support
  report `"anthropic"`. `schema` stays **1** on purpose — the version number
  tracks breaking changes, and adding an optional key breaks nobody. A consumer
  that ignores `provider` behaves exactly as it did before. Treat an unrecognized
  future value as "some other provider" rather than rejecting the document.
- **`utilization["5h"]` can be absent on an `openai` account.** The ChatGPT
  usage endpoint may report a weekly window and no session window at all.
  A missing key means **unknown**, not `0.0` — reading it as zero would make an
  account look like it has full session capacity. The same applies to
  `resets["5h"]`. (Anthropic accounts always report both windows.)
- **`absent` is new and additive.** It appears **only** on an OpenAI identity
  this host is expected to have but was never provisioned with (see
  [Declaring which identities a host should have](#declaring-which-identities-a-host-should-have));
  the key is omitted entirely for every other account, so nothing changes for a
  consumer that has never heard of it. Such an account is emitted with
  `"status": "blocked"` — an existing value that already means "do not route
  work here" — and with **no** `utilization`, `resets`, or `updated_at`, since
  nothing has ever been read for it locally. A consumer that ignores `absent`
  therefore still excludes it correctly; one that reads it can tell "the
  credential here is broken" (`blocked`) apart from "this host was never set up
  for that identity" (`blocked` + `absent`), which is what makes a fleet-wide
  "who is missing which account?" view possible at all. `schema` stays **1**.
- Accounts with a `NULL` email are still excluded entirely; `email` remains the
  sole join key, and it is not unique across providers — one person's Anthropic
  and OpenAI accounts can share an address, distinguished by `provider`.
- No credential material ever appears in this file, and neither does a
  `CODEX_HOME` path.

## Transcript Token Ingest (`tokens sync`)

The percentages this app polls tell you how much of a quota window is gone;
they do not tell you how many tokens that was. Claude Code writes that number
itself — every assistant turn in a session transcript carries a
`message.usage` block — so the app reads those counters back into
`token_usage` / `token_sessions` and keeps a real token-spend history
(it is what the per-account chart's token series is drawn from, and the
denominator any quota-calibration work needs).

```bash
llm-monitor tokens sync            # import new transcript counters
llm-monitor tokens sync --all      # no per-run file cap (full backfill)
llm-monitor tokens sync --help
```

The poll loop calls the same importer automatically on a **1-hour** cadence
(vs. the 10-minute usage poll) — the CLI exists for an immediate backfill and
for scripting.

**What it reads.** `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`, recursively — including
`subagents/agent-*.jsonl` sidechain transcripts, which on a subagent-driven
host carry a large share of the real spend. Override the root with
`--root <dir>`, `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (Claude Code's own variable), or
`$LLM_MONITOR_TRANSCRIPT_ROOT`.

**What it stores.** Per message: uuid, timestamp, model name and the four
token counters. **Never the message content.** Transcripts contain user data
and file contents; the importer decodes only counters, so nothing else can
reach the database or `debug.log`.

**Incremental by design.** A fleet host can hold 10⁵ transcripts. A file is
opened only when its mtime is newer than the stamp recorded for it
(`token_sessions.last_import_ts`), so a re-run over an unchanged tree reads
nothing. Each run opens at most 2000 files, newest first, and reports how many
it deferred; re-run (or pass `--all`) to drain a backlog. Imports are
idempotent — `token_usage.message_uuid` is UNIQUE, so re-importing a file that
grew by one record inserts exactly that one record.

**Attribution is deliberately absent.** `inferred_account_id` is left NULL.
Transcripts carry no account identity at all, and the pre-v2.0 importer's
"whichever account was polled most recently" guess is noise on a host with
~20 staggered accounts. `token_sessions.parent_session_id` records the session
a subagent transcript belongs to, so an external session→account mapping can
join on `COALESCE(parent_session_id, session_id)` when one exists.

Query it like any other table:

```bash
sqlite3 ~/.llm-monitor/usage.db \
  "SELECT date(timestamp) AS day,
          SUM(input_tokens + output_tokens + cache_creation_tokens) AS billable
     FROM token_usage GROUP BY day ORDER BY day DESC LIMIT 7;"
```

## Quota Calibration (`calibrate`)

The two series above answer different halves of the same question. Usage polls
say *how much of a weekly window is gone*; transcript ingest says *how many
tokens were spent*. Put them together and you get the number that actually
matters: **what one weekly rate-limit point costs.** Watch that figure over
time and a silent re-pricing of the quota shows up as a step change instead of
as an unexplained shortfall at the end of a week.

```bash
llm-monitor calibrate                      # trailing 14 days, JSON on stdout
llm-monitor calibrate --days 30 --csv      # CSV instead
llm-monitor calibrate --scope pool         # pool rows only
llm-monitor calibrate --no-recompute       # print what is stored, don't rewrite
llm-monitor calibrate --help
```

Results land in the `quota_calibration_daily` table and are recomputed
automatically on a **1-hour** cadence by the poll loop (macOS app and headless
alike). The CLI works on Linux without `--headless` and takes `--db`.

### What a row means

One row per `(UTC day, scope)`, where scope is `pool` (all Anthropic accounts
summed) or `account`:

```jsonc
{
  "schema": 1,
  "generated_at": "2026-09-17T12:00:00Z",
  "window_days": 14,
  "min_points_for_ratio": 5,
  "weights_version": "2026-09-18",          // the dated price table used
  "weights_source": "Anthropic published API list prices …",
  "cost_equivalent_token_baseline": "Sonnet-class input tokens at $3.00/MTok",
  "rows": [
    {
      "day": "2026-09-16",
      "scope": "pool",
      "points_consumed": 304,               // sum of positive weekly-% deltas
      "accounts_reporting": 20,             // the denominator moves — see below
      "points_per_account": 15.2,
      "input_tokens": 41000000,
      "output_tokens": 1900000,
      "cache_creation_tokens": 12000000,
      "cache_read_tokens": 930000000,
      "raw_tokens": 984900000,              // the plain sum — NOT a cost
      "cost_equivalent_tokens": 214300000,  // cost, expressed in baseline tokens
      "cost_usd": 642.9,
      "raw_tokens_per_point": 3239802.63,
      "cost_equivalent_tokens_per_point": 705000.0,
      "cost_usd_per_point": 2.115,          // the headline figure
      "weights_version": "2026-09-18"
    }
  ]
}
```

- **Points are counted as the sum of *positive* `weekly_all_percent` deltas**,
  so a weekly reset (a drop to zero) contributes nothing rather than a negative
  spike. `weekly_all_percent` is integer-valued on a real host, so **one weekly
  point is the measurement quantum** — which is why a per-point ratio only
  makes sense over a day or more, never over a single poll sample.
- **The account denominator moves.** Accounts get added, retired, or simply
  fail to poll, so a bare pool total is not comparable across days. Every pool
  row carries `accounts_reporting` and `points_per_account` alongside the raw
  total. "Reported" means *produced at least one reading that day*, not
  *consumed something*.
- **`raw_tokens` is not a cost.** A cache-read token is billed at a tenth of an
  input token and a cache write at 1.25×, so a million cache reads are a
  million raw tokens but only a hundred thousand cost-equivalent ones. The
  pre-v2.0 native host conflated the two; both are emitted here so the
  difference is visible rather than assumed.
- **`cost_equivalent_tokens` is a cost in token units** — the number of
  baseline (Sonnet-class, $3.00/MTok) input tokens that would have cost the
  same. It is emitted alongside `cost_usd` because a token figure stays
  comparable with the raw counts in the same row.
- **Only Anthropic accounts are included.** An OpenAI/Codex account's weekly
  percentage is a share of a completely different quota and its spend never
  appears in Claude Code transcripts, so mixing the two would produce a
  meaningless number.

### Reading it safely

- **A missing key means *unknown*, never `0`** (an empty field in CSV). Reading
  an absent `cost_usd_per_point` as zero would report a quota that had become
  free — the exact inverse of the alarm this series exists to raise.
- **Low-signal days report no ratio.** A day that accumulated fewer than
  `--min-points` (default 5) weekly points keeps its real point count but emits
  no `…_per_point` keys at all: with a 1-point quantum, a smaller denominator
  produces a precise-looking number that is not. Tune with `--min-points`.
- **The current UTC day carries `"partial": true`.** It is only half observed,
  so it is not comparable with completed days.
- **Per-account token attribution is opt-in and rare.** An account row always
  carries that account's own points, but token and cost columns appear **only**
  where an explicit session→account mapping exists
  (`token_sessions.override_account_id`, which subagent transcripts inherit
  through `parent_session_id`). There is deliberately no fallback to "whichever
  account polled most recently" — across ~20 staggered accounts that guess is
  close to uniform noise, and an honest absence beats a plausible fabrication.
  Pool-level rows need no attribution to be correct, which is why they are the
  sound default.
- **Prices go stale.** `weights_version` names the dated table each row was
  computed under (`QuotaCalibration.currentWeights` in the source). When
  Anthropic re-prices a model, add a new dated table — a series computed
  against a stale one drifts silently.

### Idempotence

Every run rewrites the *whole* trailing window from the source series inside
one transaction, rather than appending to what is already there. Running it
twice over unchanged inputs produces byte-identical rows and cannot duplicate
them, so the hourly cadence can never accumulate drift. `quota_calibration_daily`
is derived state — deleting it costs nothing but a recompute.

```bash
sqlite3 ~/.llm-monitor/usage.db \
  "SELECT day, points_per_account, cost_usd_per_point
     FROM quota_calibration_daily
    WHERE scope = 'pool' ORDER BY day DESC LIMIT 14;"
```

### Chart mode and the step-change alert

The per-account history window (opened by clicking an account row) gains a
**Tokens/Point** chart mode alongside % of Quota and Tokens — one point per UTC
day, plotting that account's `raw_tokens_per_point`. Like the Tokens mode, it
only appears in the mode picker once the account actually has calibration data
to show; an account with none simply never offers it.

Separately, a pure, unit-tested rule in the portable core
(`QuotaCalibration.evaluateStepChangeAlerts`) watches the **pool-wide** series
for a step change: it compares a 3-day trailing average of `tokens_per_point`
against the trailing 14-day baseline median, and alerts when the recent figure
falls to **1.5× or more below** that baseline. Two properties keep it from
misfiring on the exact incident that motivated it (#196 — a step down in
tokens/point that partially reverted ten days later):

- **Direction-aware.** Only a *drop* ever alerts. A rise — including a
  depressed regime partially recovering — is the healthy direction and never
  triggers, however large.
- **Edge-triggered with a latch.** An alert fires once, on the day the ratio
  first crosses the threshold; it does not repeat on every subsequent day the
  ratio stays depressed, and can only fire again after the ratio actually
  recovers back above the threshold and later drops a second time.

On macOS this shows as a small distinct dot next to the menu-bar percentage —
deliberately a different visual channel from the existing severity coloring
(red/orange/black-or-white), not a fourth shade competing with it — and is
suppressed under the same staleness rule that already blanks the percentage
for a stale or drifted account. In headless mode there is no menu bar to draw
into, so the alert is logged instead (`debug.log`, and stdout when run with
`--once`/foreground). The alert is re-evaluated on the same 1-hour cadence as
the calibration recompute above.

```

## Troubleshooting

### Menu bar shows "LLM --"

No data yet. Click the widget → **+ Add Account**, pick the provider, and add a
credential. Or put tokens in `~/.claude-oauth` or keys in `~/.zai`; they're picked
up automatically.

### A new account doesn't appear after import

The import dialog calls `refreshAll` after a successful add, so all 10/13/etc.
accounts should appear when the popover reopens. If a token dot stays gray,
the next 30 s poll tick hasn't filled in token status yet — click the
↻ refresh icon in the popover header.

### Rolled token still shows as valid

Anthropic-side revocation is known to be unreliable or slow to take effect
([anthropics/claude-code#43801](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/43801)),
which is why the [Roll Token wizard](#rolling-a-token-revoke--re-mint)'s final
step pings the old token itself — still answers (200/429) means still valid,
rejected (401) means revoked — instead of trusting the revoke call. If the
badge says "Still valid!", re-run the revoke console script from step 2 (it
automatically retries tokens that survive a round) and click **Verify old
token revoked** again. "Couldn't check" means the ping itself failed
(network/5xx) — try again later.

### Linux: `cannot open shared object file` on startup

```
./llm-monitor: error while loading shared libraries:
libswiftSwiftOnoneSupport.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

The binary was built **without** `--static-swift-stdlib`, so it still needs the
Swift runtime (~12 shared objects under `/usr/lib/swift/linux`). That runtime
comes from the Swift toolchain — copying the binary to a host that has no
toolchain, or uninstalling the toolchain after building, produces exactly this
loader error. Diagnose it with:

```bash
ldd /usr/local/bin/llm-monitor | grep 'not found'
```

Any unresolved `libswift*` / `libFoundation*` / `libdispatch*` entry confirms
it. The cure is to rebuild statically and re-copy — see
[Build (Linux)](#build-linux):

```bash
swift build -c release --static-swift-stdlib
sudo cp .build/release/LLMMonitor /usr/local/bin/llm-monitor
```

If the deploy host has no Swift toolchain at all, use the
[container recipe](#no-toolchain-on-the-host-build-in-a-container) and copy the
resulting binary over. `libsqlite3-0` is the one shared library that remains
required even for a static build (already present on Ubuntu 24.04).

### Logs

```
~/.llm-monitor/debug.log
```

### Database

```
~/.llm-monitor/usage.db
```

Query directly:

```bash
sqlite3 ~/.llm-monitor/usage.db "SELECT email, last_updated FROM accounts;"
sqlite3 ~/.llm-monitor/usage.db \
  "SELECT timestamp, primary_percent FROM usage_history ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

Token-spend tables (`token_sessions`, `token_usage`) are written by
[transcript token ingest](#transcript-token-ingest-tokens-sync) and keep the
column shapes the pre-v2.0 native host used, so a host that has been running
since then keeps its historical rows:

```bash
sqlite3 ~/.llm-monitor/usage.db \
  "SELECT COUNT(*), MAX(timestamp) FROM token_usage;"
```

`quota_calibration_daily` holds the derived
[quota-calibration series](#quota-calibration-calibrate) — one row per UTC day
per scope (`pool` or `account`). It is derived state: every recompute rewrites
the whole trailing window, so deleting it costs nothing but a recompute.

```bash
sqlite3 ~/.llm-monitor/usage.db \
  "SELECT day, accounts_reporting, points_per_account, cost_usd_per_point
     FROM quota_calibration_daily WHERE scope = 'pool'
    ORDER BY day DESC LIMIT 7;"
```

**`accounts` table contract for external consumers:** `email` is the stable
join key external tooling should key off of — notably `loom-daemon tokens
import-from-monitor`, which matches accounts by `email` to build its token
pool. `account_name` is a free-text, user-editable display label/alias and is
**not** guaranteed to be an address (though it often is, since renaming an
account to its own email is a common way to tell accounts apart in the UI).
The app backfills `email` from `account_name` whenever the profile-derived
email is unavailable but the label is itself a well-formed address — both at
add/rename time and via a one-time healing migration on launch — so no account
with valid credentials should persist indefinitely with `email = NULL`. If you
ever see one, it means `account_name` isn't address-shaped either; there's no
address for external tooling to recover.

## Uninstall

```bash
pkill LLMMonitor

launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.llm-monitor.plist 2>/dev/null
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.llm-monitor.plist 2>/dev/null

rm -rf ~/.llm-monitor
rm -rf /Applications/LLMMonitor.app
```

### Upgrading to 2.0 (Claude Monitor → LLM Monitor)

2.0 renames the tool. Most of the rename is automatic, and nothing that reads
the old names breaks:

| | 1.x | 2.0 | Compatibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| Data directory | `~/.claude-monitor/` | `~/.llm-monitor/` | Moved on first launch; `~/.claude-monitor` becomes a symlink to it (loom-daemon and `LOOM_CLAUDE_MONITOR_DIR` keep working) |
| CLI | `claude-monitor` | `llm-monitor` | `install-linux.sh` keeps `claude-monitor` as a symlink alias; `accounts push` still calls `claude-monitor` on peers |
| Env overrides | `CLAUDE_MONITOR_*` | `LLM_MONITOR_*` | Old names still honored (new ones win) |
| systemd unit | `claude-monitor.service` | `llm-monitor.service` | `install-linux.sh` stops and removes the old unit |
| macOS app | `ClaudeMonitor.app`, `com.claude-monitor.app` | `LLMMonitor.app`, `com.llm-monitor.app` | Manual (below) |
| Linux release asset | `claude-monitor-linux-x64` | `llm-monitor-linux-x64` | Both are attached to each release |

**Linux:** re-run `install-linux.sh --from-release` (or `--binary`). It handles
the binary, the alias, the unit, and the data directory.

**macOS:** the app bundle has a new name, so the old one is not replaced:

```bash
osascript -e 'quit app "Claude Monitor"'; sleep 2
rm -rf /Applications/ClaudeMonitor.app
cp -R build/LLMMonitor.app /Applications/LLMMonitor.app
open /Applications/LLMMonitor.app     # moves ~/.claude-monitor on first launch
```

If you use the login LaunchAgent, unload `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.claude-monitor.plist`,
delete it, and recreate it under the new name ([Auto-Start on Login](#auto-start-on-login-optional)).
If a CLI symlink points into the old bundle, re-point it at
`/Applications/LLMMonitor.app/Contents/MacOS/LLMMonitor`.

If the app finds both `~/.claude-monitor` and `~/.llm-monitor` as real
directories, it moves and merges nothing. It uses `~/.llm-monitor` and logs the
conflict to stderr, so merge or remove the old directory yourself.

### Upgrading from pre-1.8

Versions before 1.8 shipped a Node CLI (`dist/cli.js`) that was removed in the v1.8 Swift rewrite. Its build artifacts are untracked, so they linger in old checkouts and fail confusingly if run (e.g. `node dist/cli.js` errors with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `commander`). Clean them up:

```bash
rm -rf dist node_modules
```
