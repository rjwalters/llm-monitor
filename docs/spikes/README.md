# Spikes

Time-boxed investigation write-ups. A spike answers one question — "is this
feasible", "what does this endpoint actually return" — and its value is the
evidence, not the code.

Conventions:

- **Name files `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`.** A spike is a snapshot of what was true
  on a date, not living documentation.
- **State clearly what was verified versus assumed.** These documents get read
  later as if they were contracts, so an unverified hypothesis has to be
  labelled as one.
- **When a later run supersedes an earlier finding, mark the superseding
  section as authoritative in place** rather than deleting the original. The
  wrong first answer and the reason it was wrong are usually the most useful
  part.

## Index

| Spike | Question | Outcome |
|-------|----------|---------|
| [2026-07-30-codex-usage-probe.md](2026-07-30-codex-usage-probe.md) | Can a cheap authenticated probe read ChatGPT/Codex subscription usage and rate-limit windows? | **Yes**, but not the way the spike concluded — see the 2026-08-15 supersession. `codex app-server` is the supported surface; `GET wham/usage` is the fallback. |
| [2026-09-27-glideslope-evaluation.md](2026-09-27-glideslope-evaluation.md) | Should llm-monitor adopt anything from Stage-11-Agentics/glideslope? | **One idea**: the elapsed-time-normalized "even burn" mark (#220). The comparison also surfaced a missing reset bound on time-to-limit (#221). Credentials already converged; pool and cost figures answer different questions; the menu bar is a differentiator. |

### Reading the Codex probe write-up

That document has three layers, and only the last is binding. It opens with
static analysis of the Codex CLI binary, which produced a plausible but
**wrong** guess at the wire format. The "Live verification (AUTHORITATIVE)"
section records what a real request returned and corrects it — different field
names, a different route, and the discovery that a session window may
legitimately be absent.

The **2026-08-15 supersession** at the end then reverses the spike's central
*design* recommendation. The spike never ran a successful token refresh, so it
could not tell that OpenAI rotates refresh tokens; it recommended storing and
refreshing one anyway, and that shipped and broke — a stored copy and the Codex
CLI's own `auth.json` invalidate each other in turn. The app should hold no
OpenAI credential at all, and read usage over `codex app-server` instead.

Design against the supersession section. `OpenAIAPI.swift` and
`RateLimitWindow.swift` still cite the live-verification section, which remains
correct as the fallback wire contract.

`codex-usage-probe.sh` beside it is runnable: it prints only status codes and
redacted field names, never token values.
