/// **`oauth_credentials.is_active` is deliberately NOT part of this predicate.**

///
/// 1. *Different question.* Absence answers "was this identity ever provisioned
///    on this host?", not "will it poll on the next cycle?". A credential that
///    was provisioned here and later deactivated is a different condition, and
///    the remediation absence prints (`codex provision <label>`) is aimed at the
///    other one. Staleness — not absence — is the surface that already reports a
///    row that has stopped updating.
/// 2. *It would not buy the exactness it appears to.* `isAbsentCodexIdentity`'s
///    doc comment above claims its first two conditions negate
///    `loadActiveCredentials`'s admission test. Adding `is_active` to the token
///    half alone would not make that literally true, because that test also
///    gates its *home-registered* clause on `c.is_active = 1`, while
///    `hasCodexHome` here reads only `accounts.codex_home`. The claim is
///    therefore stated in terms of the token/home shape, not `is_active`; see
///    the qualification recorded there.
/// 3. *It carries live risk for no reachable benefit.* `deactivateCredential`
///    has no callers anywhere in the package (superseded by `deleteAccount`,
///    #106), so `is_active = 0` alongside a stored token only arises from
///    importing a pre-#106 database. Meanwhile `openAIAccountCount()` shares
///    this fragment and **fails closed** on purpose — undercounting OpenAI
///    accounts is what licenses the ambient home. Making that count depend on a
