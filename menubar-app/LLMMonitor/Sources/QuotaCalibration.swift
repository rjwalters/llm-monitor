/// Daily quota-calibration series: how much *spend* one weekly rate-limit
/// point actually buys (#198, phase 2 of #196).
///
/// The question this answers is "what is a weekly point worth?" — in tokens, in
/// cost-equivalent tokens, and in dollars — so a downstream consumer
/// (rjwalters/loom#8063) can watch that figure for a step change and notice
/// that Anthropic re-priced the quota underneath the fleet.
///
/// ## Why a rolling daily series, and not at-reset rows
///
/// The pre-v2.0 native host computed calibration **only** inside its
/// reset-detection branch (`b9db622^:native-host/claude_monitor_host.cjs:698`),
/// which is at best one row per account per weekly reset and in practice was
/// never populated at all. Worse, its period start came from
/// `getLastCalibrationReset`, which fell back to `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z` on an
/// empty table — so the first row it would ever have written summed every token
/// the host had ever seen. Neither defect is reproduced here: the primary
/// artifact is a per-UTC-day series, recomputed over a trailing window from
/// scratch every run.
///
/// ## How points are counted
///
/// `usage_history.weekly_all_percent` is integer-valued (0.0, 1.0, … 100.0 —
/// 101 distinct values observed over a multi-week window), so **one weekly
/// point is the measurement quantum**. Consumption for a day is the sum of the
/// *positive* deltas between consecutive samples, which discards the drop to
/// zero at a weekly reset while keeping every real increment.
///
/// Two details make that sum correct rather than approximately correct:
///
/// * **Ordering ties are real and must break on `(timestamp, id)`.** When a
///   reset is detected, `OAuthPoller.writeUsageToDB` inserts a synthetic
///   carry-forward row and a synthetic `0` row, and that `0` row shares its
///   whole-second timestamp with the real row written immediately after it
///   (observed live: `2026-09-17T18:07:09Z|0.0|is_synthetic=1` followed by
///   `2026-09-17T18:07:09Z|0.0|is_synthetic=0`). Ordering by timestamp alone
///   leaves that pair's order unspecified, and the wrong order manufactures a
///   spurious positive delta at exactly the boundary where the series is most
///   fragile. Rows are therefore sorted by `(parsed timestamp, rowid)` — and
///   parsed, not compared as text, because this codebase writes ISO 8601 both
///   with and without fractional seconds and those two shapes do **not** sort
///   lexically against each other.
/// * **Synthetic rows are kept, not filtered.** The synthetic carry-forward row
///   is what makes the drop to zero a single negative delta instead of a lost
///   increment; dropping it would under-count every reset day.
///
/// ## Why the account denominator moves
///
/// The number of accounts reporting on a given day is not constant (19 → 15 →
/// 19 → 20 across one measured window, as accounts are added, retired, or
/// simply fail to poll). A bare pool total is therefore not comparable across
/// days, so every pool row carries `accountsReporting` and `pointsPerAccount`
/// alongside it. "Reported" means *produced at least one `weekly_all_percent`
/// reading that day* — not "consumed something", because an idle account is
/// still part of the pool it is being averaged over.
///
/// ## Anthropic accounts only
///
/// A `provider = 'openai'` account also stores a `weekly_all_percent`, but it
/// is a percentage of a completely different quota and its spend does not
/// appear in Claude Code transcripts at all. Summing the two pools would
/// produce a number with no meaning, so the points series is restricted to
/// Anthropic accounts (a `usage_history` row whose account row is missing
/// entirely is treated as Anthropic, matching `AccountProvider.fallback`).
///
/// ## Isolation
///
/// A plain `enum` namespace of pure static functions over a database path — no
/// shared mutable state and no actor isolation, so the CLI, the poll loop's
/// detached task, and `SelfTest` can all call it directly.
