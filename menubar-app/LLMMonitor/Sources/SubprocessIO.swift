/// read source, and when a child writes and then exits, the kernel makes the
/// data *and* the hangup available in the same epoll wakeup — the source fires
/// once with the bytes, is torn down, and **the terminating zero-byte callback
/// is never delivered**. Reduced to 15 lines and measured in a stock `swift:6.1`
/// container, a child that runs `echo hi >&2; exit 3` loses that callback on
/// roughly two runs in three; a child that writes *nothing* before exiting never
/// loses it, which is exactly why this stayed invisible for so long — the stream
/// that carries no output always completed, and only the one carrying the
/// diagnostic hung.
///
/// The cost of that was not a flaky test but a **permanent hang**: the drain's
