import Foundation

/// Emits `~/.llm-monitor/ranking.json` — a small, **non-secret**, email-keyed
/// snapshot of per-account utilization / resets / status for external multi-account
/// load balancers (loom, lean-genius). See issue #2.
///
/// Design contract:
/// - **No secrets.** Only derived numbers (utilization, reset timestamps, status)
///   are emitted. OAuth access/refresh tokens and raw API headers are never read
///   into this file. The only join key is `email`.
/// - **Atomic.** The file is written with `Data.write(options: .atomic)` (temp file
///   in the same directory + rename) so consumers never observe a partial/truncated
///   document.
/// - **Best-effort.** A failure to read any single account, or to open the DB, must
///   not crash the app — the exporter logs and returns. Optional data (the `models`
///   / Fable field, backed by the externally-populated `probe_snapshots` table) is
///   simply omitted when unavailable rather than failing the whole export.
///
/// ### Schema v1
/// ```json
/// {
///   "schema": 1,
///   "generated_at": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z",
///   "accounts": [
///     {
///       "email": "user@example.com",
///       "provider": "anthropic",
///       "plan": "max_20x",
///       "status": "available",
///       "utilization": { "5h": 0.12, "7d": 0.44 },
///       "resets":      { "5h": "2026-01-01T02:00:00Z", "7d": "2026-01-04T00:00:00Z" },
///       "models":      { "fable": { "utilization": 0.30 } },
///       "updated_at":  "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z"
///     }
///   ]
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### `provider` (added in epic #25 phase 3)
///
/// `provider` is `"anthropic"` or `"openai"` and is **additive within schema 1**:
/// the version number tracks *breaking* changes, and adding an optional key
/// breaks nobody. A consumer that ignores it behaves exactly as before (every
/// account predating multi-provider support reports `"anthropic"`); a consumer
/// that reads it can route work to the right upstream. Unknown future values
/// should be treated as "some other provider", never rejected.
///
/// **A `provider: "openai"` account may legitimately omit `utilization["5h"]`**
/// — the live-verified Codex usage endpoint can report a weekly window and no
/// session window at all. Consumers must treat a missing key as *unknown*, not
/// as 0.0 (which would read as "full session capacity available").
///
/// ### `absent` (added in #135)
///
/// `"absent": true` marks an OpenAI identity this host is *expected* to have
/// but was never provisioned with — a placeholder row created by pasting an
/// identity-only transfer payload (see `OAuthPoller.declareCodexIdentity`).
/// Codex homes are host-local by design (#104), so this is how a fleet-wide
/// consumer can tell "this host is missing one of the three Codex identities"
/// apart from "that identity does not exist anywhere".
///
/// It is **additive within schema 1** on the same reasoning as `provider`:
/// - The key is **omitted entirely** for every normal account, so nothing
///   changes for a consumer that has never heard of it.
/// - An absent account is emitted with `"status": "blocked"` — an existing,
///   already-understood value meaning "do not route work here" — and with no
///   `utilization`/`resets`/`updated_at` keys at all. So a consumer that
///   ignores `absent` still excludes it from its pool exactly as it excludes
///   any other blocked account; it simply cannot say *why*.
/// - A consumer that reads it can distinguish "credential is broken here"
///   (`blocked`, no `absent`) from "never set up here" (`blocked` + `absent`),
///   which is the whole point.
